.. py:function:: fetch_all_exercises()

   Fetches all exercise data from the 'wger.de' API.

   This function makes requests to the 'wger.de' API to retrieve information about various exercises.
   It compiles this data into a list of dictionaries, each representing an exercise with details such as
   name, description, equipment, muscles targeted, and an ID. This list can be converted into a DataFrame
   for further analysis and manipulation.

   :returns: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains data about an exercise.
   :rtype: List[Dict]


.. py:function:: find_exercises_by_muscle(dataframe, muscle)

   Filters exercises by a specified muscle group from a given DataFrame.

   This function takes a DataFrame containing exercise data and an integer representing a muscle group.
   It filters the DataFrame to find exercises that target the specified muscle group.

   :param dataframe: A DataFrame containing exercise data.
   :type dataframe: pd.DataFrame
   :param muscle: An integer representing the muscle group to filter by.
   :type muscle: int

   :returns: A DataFrame containing exercises that target the specified muscle group.
   :rtype: pd.DataFrame


.. py:function:: find_exercises_by_equipment(dataframe, equipment)

   Filters exercises by specified equipment from a given DataFrame.

   This function takes a DataFrame containing exercise data and an integer representing equipment.

.. py:function:: find_best_exercise(dataframe, equipment, muscle)

   Filters exercises from a DataFrame that match both specific equipment and muscle group.

   This function filters the provided DataFrame to find exercises that both use the specified equipment
   and target the specified muscle group. The function takes integers representing both equipment and muscle.

   :param dataframe: A DataFrame containing exercise data.
   :type dataframe: pd.DataFrame
   :param equipment: An integer representing the equipment to filter by.
   :type equipment: int
   :param muscle: An integer representing the muscle group to filter by.
